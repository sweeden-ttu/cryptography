# Cryptography – Symmetric Encryption Basics

[Stub] Outline of core ideas: secret-key encryption, ideal cipher model, and how block ciphers are used in practice.

## Topics

- Symmetric vs. asymmetric cryptography  
- Block ciphers and stream ciphers at a high level  
- Modes of operation (ECB vs. CBC vs. CTR – conceptual overview)  
- Threat models and basic security notions (e.g., ciphertext-only, known-plaintext)  

## Reading and Preparation
