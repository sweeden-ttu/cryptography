# Cryptography – Block Ciphers and Modes of Operation

[Stub] Overview of block cipher structure and the intuition behind standard modes of operation.

## Topics

- Block cipher abstraction and security intuition  
- ECB vs. CBC vs. CTR (high-level)  
- Initialization vectors and randomness requirements  
- Common pitfalls (pattern leakage, replay, misuse of IVs)  

## Reading and Preparation

[Stub] Link to Canvas slides or textbook sections on block cipher modes.
