# Cryptography – Course Overview and Foundations

[Stub] High-level course overview, syllabus highlights, grading policies, and a preview of core cryptographic themes (confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and threat models).

## Topics

- Administrative details and course structure  
- What problems cryptography solves (and does not solve)  
- Basic security properties: confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation  
- Real-world examples of cryptographic failures and successes  

## Reading and Preparation

[Stub] Link to syllabus and any introductory reading from the course textbook or recommended articles.
