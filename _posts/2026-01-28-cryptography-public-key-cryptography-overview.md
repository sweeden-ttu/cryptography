# Cryptography – Public-Key Cryptography Overview

[Stub] Conceptual introduction to key pairs, one-way functions, and why public-key cryptography changed how we design secure protocols.

## Topics

- Symmetric vs. public-key tradeoffs  
- High-level structure of public-key encryption and digital signatures  
- Trust and key distribution at a conceptual level  
- How number theory supports these constructions  

## Reading and Preparation

[Stub] Reference the Canvas module and textbook sections on public-key cryptography (e.g., RSA overview).
