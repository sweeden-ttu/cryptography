# Cryptography – Number Theory Prerequisites

[Stub] Short mathematical warm-up for modular arithmetic, gcd, and related concepts that appear in later cryptographic constructions.

## Topics

- Modular arithmetic and congruences  
- Greatest common divisor and Euclid’s algorithm  
- Modular inverses (conceptual)  
- How these tools show up in cryptographic schemes  

## Reading and Preparation

[Stub] Reference the Canvas module or textbook sections on number theory for cryptography.
