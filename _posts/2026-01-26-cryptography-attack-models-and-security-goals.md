# Cryptography – Attack Models and Security Goals

[Stub] Discussion of how we model adversaries and define what “secure” actually means for cryptographic schemes.

## Topics

- Adversary capabilities and threat models  
- Security notions for encryption (e.g., indistinguishability) at a high level  
- Chosen-plaintext and chosen-ciphertext attacks (intuition)  
- Why precise goals matter before designing schemes  

## Reading and Preparation

[Stub] Refer to Canvas modules or textbook sections on security definitions and attack models.
